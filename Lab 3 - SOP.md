## Purpose
[Crafting a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) document about setup a Windows server.]

## Application
[Unified installation process for Windows Server for IT staff in schools.]

## Definitions

- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**: A firmware interface that initializes hardware during boot and provides runtime services for operating systems and programs.
- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: A modern version of BIOS, offering more advanced features like faster boot times, larger disk support, and secure boot capabilities.
- **ISO Image**: A file that contains the complete image of a CD, DVD, or other media, often used for installing operating systems.
- **Bootable USB/DVD**: A storage device or disc that contains an operating system installation or recovery image, allowing the system to boot from it.
- **Server Manager**: A Windows Server tool used for managing server roles, features, and configurations.
- **Administrator Password**: The password for the user account with full system control, used to manage system settings, install software, and configure security.


## Procedure steps

### Step 1: Prepare Installation Media
- **Action**: Create a bootable USB drive or burn an ISO image to a DVD.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Make sure you're using the right Windows Server version and that your USB/DVD is properly formatted. Using the wrong media can cause installation issues.

---

### Step 2: Configure BIOS/UEFI Settings
- **Action**: Reboot the system and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup. Set the boot order to prioritize USB/DVD as the first boot device.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Incorrect BIOS settings can cause the server to fail to boot from the installation media. Be cautious when modifying BIOS settings.

---

### Step 3: Start Installation
- **Action**: Insert the bootable USB/DVD and restart the server. The installation process will begin.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Some systems may not automatically boot from USB/DVD. You may need to manually select the boot device from the BIOS boot menu.

---

### Step 4: Select Language and Region Settings
- **Action**: Choose the desired language, time, and currency format, then click "Next."
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Ensure the correct region and language are selected, as this will affect system settings, including date/time and keyboard layout.

---

### Step 5: Install Windows Server
- **Action**: Click "Install Now" and enter the product key (if required). Choose the edition of Windows Server you want to install.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Ensure that you have the correct product key. Selecting the wrong edition could cause issues with activation later.

---

### Step 6: Select Installation Disk
- **Action**: Choose the disk where Windows Server will be installed. You may need to format the disk.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Be careful when selecting the disk, as formatting will erase all data on the selected drive. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.

---

### Step 7: Wait for Installation to Complete
- **Action**: The system will copy files and install Windows Server. The server will automatically restart multiple times during this process.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: The installation can take some time, depending on the server hardware. Ensure there is no interruption during the installation process (e.g., power loss or manual shutdown).

---
### Step 8: Configure Server Settings
- **Action**: After installation, you will need to set up initial configuration such as the Administrator password, network settings, and system preferences.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Choose a strong administrator password, as it is critical for securing the system. Misconfiguring network settings may prevent the server from connecting to the network.

---

### Step 9: Complete Windows Server Setup
- **Action**: After finalizing configuration, Windows Server will boot into the desktop environment or Server Manager, where you can begin managing the server.
- **Known Hazards/Difficulties**: Ensure that all necessary updates are applied after the installation is complete to avoid security vulnerabilities.

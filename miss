I second your suggestion  我赞同你的建议

I agree that we have choices,

Hey Mark i've noticed recently that you've been making eyes at Amy sitting over there in the corner cubicle i think you'd really like to get to know her better，
but I do know as well that you're quite shy may I offer some advice to help you feel more comfortable approaching her，
and then together we can brainstorm some topics of conversation so you can break the iceand get in there and get to know her better.
So Mark I notice that Amy has a second cup of coffee midm
31:52
morning just about every day so how about this when you see Amy go into the back kitchen to pour herself a cup why
31:59
don't you find your way to the kitchen you can either uh make a fresh pot take
32:04
the opportunity to make conversation with her and then walk her back to her seat in the office something like that
32:10
would work right

miss them.   


worsened income inequality  收入不平等加剧

vibrant colors              鲜艳的色彩

ropes with tassels          流苏绳

a novel way                 一种新颖的方式

bound to stir               必然会引起轰动

controversial social issue  备受争议的社会问题

advocating for constraints  提倡限制

it would be honour to host you.

bright scarlet mural        亮眼猩红色的壁画

third-grader                三年级学生

delirious                   笑得神志不清

chunkling on the floor      地板上发出咚咚声

honour to host you

spare the time to           抽出时间

they hang on to every words 他们记住每一个字

huge fan of your books

a sense of wonder and amazement 惊奇和惊讶的感觉

plan to hold * *  session  计划举行**次会议

been eyeing that            一直在关注

you've been making eyes at  你一直在抛媚眼

strolling                   漫步

arm in arm as they are gazing lovingly
into each other's eyes                      他们手挽着手，深情地凝视着对方的眼睛

Extra large box of buttered popcorn         超大盒的黄油爆米花

tremendous mess             巨大的混乱



Cheers，                    

I second your suggestion  我赞同你的建议

Hey Mark i've noticed recently that you've been making eyes at Amy sitting over there in the corner cubicle i think you'd really like to get to know her better，
but I do know as well that you're quite shy may I offer some advice to help you feel more comfortable approaching her，
and then together we can brainstorm some topics of conversation so you can break the iceand get in there and get to know her better.
So Mark I notice that Amy has a second cup of coffee midm
31:52
morning just about every day so how about this when you see Amy go into the back kitchen to pour herself a cup why
31:59
don't you find your way to the kitchen you can either uh make a fresh pot take
32:04
the opportunity to make conversation with her and then walk her back to her seat in the office something like that
32:10
would work right

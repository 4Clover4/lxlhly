Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my mixed feelings about your recent announcement. While I am genuinely happy for your new position as a full-time professor at another university, I cannot help but feel a sense of loss knowing that you will no longer be teaching at our local university.

Your class has been an incredible experience for me. I particularly enjoyed your engaging teaching style and the way you made complex concepts easy to understand. The practical examples you provided were directly applicable to my job, and I have already seen improvements in my work performance as a result of your course.

As you embark on this new chapter in your career, I would very much like to stay in touch. Perhaps we could connect through LinkedIn or exchange professional emails occasionally? I would greatly value the opportunity to continue learning from your expertise and insights.

Wishing you all the best in your new position.

Sincerely,
Paul



Subject: Suggestion: Host a Dinner Party Instead of Selling Chocolate Bars

Dear Manager,

I believe hosting a dinner party is a better option than selling chocolate bars over the next two months.

First, we need the funds by the end of this month to support the New Year's celebration. Selling chocolate may take too long to raise sufficient money. A dinner party, on the other hand, can be organized before Christmas and help us reach our goal on time.

Second, a dinner event can bring families and neighbors together. People in our community are often busy with work or school, and rarely get a chance to connect. A gathering would strengthen our community spirit, especially during the holiday season. Since our neighborhood is relatively affluent, the cost should not be a major concern for most residents.

Lastly, although selling chocolate is a traditional method, it may not be effective in our case. Our community has few children, and many residents prefer a healthy lifestyle, which could make chocolate sales difficult.

This is just my opinion, and Iâ€™d be happy to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
Paul

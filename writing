Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my mixed feelings about your recent announcement. While I am genuinely happy for your new position as a full-time professor at another university, I cannot help but feel a sense of loss knowing that you will no longer be teaching at our local university.

Your class has been an incredible experience for me. I particularly enjoyed your engaging teaching style and the way you made complex concepts easy to understand. The practical examples you provided were directly applicable to my job, and I have already seen improvements in my work performance as a result of your course.

As you embark on this new chapter in your career, I would very much like to stay in touch. Perhaps we could connect through LinkedIn or exchange professional emails occasionally? I would greatly value the opportunity to continue learning from your expertise and insights.

Wishing you all the best in your new position.

Sincerely,
Paul

Subject: Suggestion: Host a Dinner Party Instead of Selling Chocolate Bars

Dear Manager,

I believe hosting a dinner party is a better option than selling chocolate bars over the next two months.

First, we need the funds by the end of this month to support the New Year's celebration. Selling chocolate may take too long to raise sufficient money. A dinner party, on the other hand, can be organized before Christmas and help us reach our goal on time.

Second, a dinner event can bring families and neighbors together. People in our community are often busy with work or school, and rarely get a chance to connect. A gathering would strengthen our community spirit, especially during the holiday season. Since our neighborhood is relatively affluent, the cost should not be a major concern for most residents.

Lastly, although selling chocolate is a traditional method, it may not be effective in our case. Our community has few children, and many residents prefer a healthy lifestyle, which could make chocolate sales difficult.

This is just my opinion, and I’d be happy to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
Paul

I would like to help plan and host a dinner party for our workplace fundraiser. This option offers several significant advantages over selling chocolate bars.

Firstly, the dinner party provides a more efficient way to reach our fundraising goal. By charging $30 per guest, we would only need to attract approximately 34 attendees to meet our $1,000 target. This is considerably more manageable than selling 500 chocolate bars over two months. The dinner format also allows us to showcase our community spirit and strengthen relationships with local businesses by hosting the event at a neighborhood restaurant.

Secondly, this approach offers better value for participants. While $30 might seem substantial, guests will receive a complete dining experience in return, making it a more attractive proposition than repeatedly purchasing chocolate bars. The social aspect of the dinner also creates a more memorable and enjoyable fundraising experience for all involved.

In conclusion, hosting a dinner party represents a more effective and engaging fundraising strategy that aligns with our community values while efficiently achieving our financial objectives.







I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the $2,000 award offered by our school to help with college fees. I am currently studying Computer Science, a field I am deeply passionate about. My interest in technology started at a young age, and I have always been fascinated by how computers can solve complex problems.

At college, I have been performing well academically, maintaining a GPA of 3.8. I have also been actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including the coding club and volunteer work at local schools, where I teach basic computer skills to children. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also my ability to work in a team and communicate effectively.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a career in software development, focusing on creating applications that can make a positive impact on society. Receiving this award would significantly ease my financial burden and allow me to concentrate more on my studies and future projects. Thank you for considering my application.

Regards,

Subject: Scholarship Application – Network and System Administration Program

Dear UBC Scholarship Committee,

My name is Mila, and I am currently in my second year of the Network and System Administration (NSA) program at UBC. I am writing to express my sincere interest in applying for the $2,000 scholarship.

Over the past two years, I have developed a strong passion for networking through my coursework and lab experiences. The hands-on training in the network lab has been especially engaging, and it inspired me to build my own homelab to continue learning and experimenting outside of class.

In addition to my academic work, I had the opportunity to present to high school students, demonstrating how to assemble a desktop computer and explaining its components. It was a rewarding experience that helped me build confidence and improve my communication skills.

I previously received the President’s Award, a moment that remains deeply meaningful to me. I still remember the president's words: “You deserve this—enjoy it.” That encouragement reinforced my decision to pursue a career in technology. As a result, I have decided to continue my education in the Cybersecurity program next year.

I was encouraged by my instructor, Felix, to apply for this scholarship based on my performance and dedication. I would be truly grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,
Mila
Network and System Administration Student

I would like to express my preference for maintaining the current evening class schedule of one 3-hour session per week. This format has proven effective for my learning needs and personal schedule.

Firstly, the single extended session allows for deeper immersion in course material. The uninterrupted three-hour block enables comprehensive coverage of topics, facilitating better understanding and retention. This is particularly valuable for complex subjects that require sustained focus and in-depth discussion.

Secondly, the current schedule better accommodates my work and personal commitments. Attending classes only once per week reduces transportation time and costs, while allowing me to better organize my other responsibilities. The proposed twice-weekly schedule would significantly increase my time commitment and potentially create scheduling conflicts.

In conclusion, I believe the existing 3-hour weekly format strikes an optimal balance between academic effectiveness and practical considerations. I would strongly recommend maintaining this schedule to support student success and work-life balance.

Dear Mordy,

I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out to inquire about increasing my monthly loan payment, which is currently $400.

I borrowed $20,000 last January to pay my tuition at MIT College. I have now graduated and am earning a good income from my new job as a Network Operations Center Administrator at RBC. Therefore, I would like to increase my monthly payment from $400 to $800.

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any extra fees associated with changing the payment plan. Since I am considering shortening the repayment timeline, having this information would greatly assist me in making an informed decision.

I would appreciate a prompt response at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Mila

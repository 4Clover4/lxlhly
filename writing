Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my mixed feelings about your recent announcement. While I am genuinely happy for your new position as a full-time professor at another university, I cannot help but feel a sense of loss knowing that you will no longer be teaching at our local university.

Your class has been an incredible experience for me. I particularly enjoyed your engaging teaching style and the way you made complex concepts easy to understand. The practical examples you provided were directly applicable to my job, and I have already seen improvements in my work performance as a result of your course.

As you embark on this new chapter in your career, I would very much like to stay in touch. Perhaps we could connect through LinkedIn or exchange professional emails occasionally? I would greatly value the opportunity to continue learning from your expertise and insights.

Wishing you all the best in your new position.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
